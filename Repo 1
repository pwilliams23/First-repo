# This is my first repository.

I'm beginning to use to tools that Github has provided for me and I can say with confidence that this is an app that I have long neglected.
Going into this initially, I had my own doubts about myself and began to wonder if this would something I would enjoy doing and so far, I 
have not beeen disapppointed. This is all still very new to me, but I intend on striving as much as I can as I begin to be exposed to this
new light.

# :wave: About me 

A little about myself is:
- I am 30 years old
- I'm one of the first in my family to go to college, and the first to be an honors student
- I'm from Newark, NJ and moved around quite a bit before settling in the Lehigh Valley
- I enjoy movies, sports, spending time with family and always down to learn new things
